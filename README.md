# ModTemplateValheim
Template mod for Valheim using Bepinex that can call methods from the in-game console.

Template auto builds to following into the game automatically:
 - BepInEx (Unstripped UnityEngine dlls too) + HarmonyX
 - Publicized dll dependencies to managed game dlls
 - Moves your mod into the BepInEx plugins folder.

## How to use template
 - Build project (maybe twice to be sure): PLAY!

## Requirements
 - MSBuild 16+ (installed with Visual Studio)
 - Git (used to download & build Publicizer to publicize the game DLLs)
