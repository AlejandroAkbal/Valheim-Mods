# MethodCallCommand-Valheim
Template mod for Valheim using Bepinex that can call methods from the in-game console.

## Requirements
 - Unstripped dlls from Unity 2019.4.20 to make BepInEx work.

## How to use template
 - Rename project
 - Install unstripped UnityEngine.dll files
 - Build it twice (IDE doesn't like to resolve dynamic references)
 - Start game :D
