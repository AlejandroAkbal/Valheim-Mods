# ModTemplateValheim
Template mod for Valheim using Bepinex that can call methods from the in-game console.

## How to use template
 - Rename project
 - Install unstripped UnityEngine.dll files
 - Build it twice (first time will complain about missing types/references)
 - Start game to test your mod :D

## Requirements
 - MSBuild 16+ (installed with Visual Studio)
 - Git (used to download & build Publicizer to publicize the game DLLs)
 - Unstripped dlls from Unity 2019.4.20 to make BepInEx work.
